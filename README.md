# D_2n Homometry

C algorithms for brute-force enumeration of homometric sets in the dihedral groups D_2n

==========

Start the C program:

    >>> ./D2n_homomenumerate homometry_type n p

where

  * *homometry_type* is either *left* or *right*
  * *n* is an integer defining the order of the D_2n dihedral group
  * *p* is an integer defining the cardinality of the subsets of D_2n to be
        examined.
